FastSolutionEvaluator
=====================

Little WPF tool to rapidly browse subdirectories containing csharp code (handy if you need to manually evaluate/compare a large stack of projects)

Two additonial experimental branches exist:
	*ConsoleControl: utilizes a control to show output of compiled project (buggy: crashes when second program is run)
	*SyntaxHighlighter: highlights code keywords in codeviewer pane. Works pretty slow so isn't really what this project is all about....SPEEEED.
